# Emencia on the spanish PyConEs 2015

## A weekend of python on Valencia

The [PyConEs](http://2015.es.pycon.org/en/) is a event organized by the ["Asociación Python España"](http://www.es.python.org/)for the python community with the aim of promote the language and support his users, and is the most important conference on his kind of the country.

On this edition, the third, Emencia, with the aim of supporting the language and the open source knowledge culture, promoted the event as sponsor.

The event started the last Friday 20-11-15 with a series of interesting workshops, 6+1, including a [django girls](https://djangogirls.org/pycones2015/) workshop, and covering topics like asyncIO or Bokeh.

Saturday was the starting point of the conferences, with the aperture in charge of [Yamila Moreno](http://moduslaborandi.net/), aiming the community to be an even better place for everybody, doing a brave act of self-criticism of the community, and 'linting' it, with a brand new tool called ["pepa"](https://github.com/yamila-moreno/pepa).

The conferences where ordered on three tracks, basic, advanced and data-science, on a total of 27! talks in one day, a delicious bunch of python for every taste, with such amount of topics pick one to assist was a really hard task.

On my personal schedule for the Saturday, the favorites were:

  - "#!/usr/bin/python (Python para Sysadmins)" by Andreu Belmonte Peña.

  A Java programmer, amazing DevOps at ofertia, with a pythonic soul, showed us how to use the python batteries to help managing systems, and how to defeat a python hater on a programming competition.

  - "Escalando una web con python", by Jose Ignacio Galarza.

  CTO at "ticketea", condensed amazingly well a big amount of interesting topics on scaling python web based applications.

  - "La maquinaria de import, ese mágico desconocido", by Raúl Cumplido.

  Smart journey following the import machinery of the python interpreter.

  - "Python tips, tricks and dark magic",
  - "Objetos mutable e inmutables y errores típicos",
