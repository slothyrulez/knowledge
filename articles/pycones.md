# Emencia on the spanish PyConEs 2015

## A weekend of python on Valencia

The [PyConEs](http://2015.es.pycon.org/en/) is a event organized by the ["Asociación Python España"](http://www.es.python.org/) for the python community with the aim of promote the language and support his users, and is the most important conference on his kind of the country.

On this edition, the third, Emencia, helped supporting the language and the open source knowledge culture, promoting the event as sponsor.

The event started the last Friday 20-11-15 with a series of interesting workshops, 6+1, including a [django girls](https://djangogirls.org/pycones2015/) workshop, and covering topics like asyncIO or Bokeh.

Saturday was the starting point of the conferences, with the aperture in charge of [Yamila Moreno](http://moduslaborandi.net/), aiming the community to be an even better place for everybody, doing a brave act of self-criticism of the community, and 'linting' it, with a brand new tool called ["pepa"](https://github.com/yamila-moreno/pepa).

The conferences where ordered on three tracks, basic, advanced and data-science, on a total of 27! Talks in one day, a delicious bunch of python for every taste, with such amount of topics pick one to assist was a really hard task. On my personal schedule for the Saturday, the favorites were:   

 - "#!/usr/bin/python (Python para Sysadmins)" by Andreu Belmonte Peña.

  A Java programmer, amazing DevOps at ofertia, with a pythonic
  soul, showed us how to use the python batteries to help managing
  systems, and how to defeat a python hater on a programming competition.

 - "Escalando una web con python" by Jose Ignacio Galarza.

  CTO at "ticketea", condensed amazingly well a big amount of interesting topics on scaling python web based applications.

 - "La maquinaria de import, ese mágico desconocido" by Raúl Cumplido.

  Smart journey following the import machinery of the python interpreter.   

 - "Revisión de código en Python" by Cesar Cardenas Desales.

  Or, the benefits, how and why organize a work-flow of code revision on a collaborative developing environment, Software Architect at Webrepublic, wise person, one of those inspiring talks teaching human experiences, again, great talk.

 - "Django request-response: Un viaje de ida y vuelta" by Imanol Cea

  Another interesting journey in the hand of a "ticketea" developer following the route of a request and response on the Django framework.

 - "Extending Python" by Francisco Fernández Castaño

  Some examples of extending a python program using C with the three main methods. With such an extended topic, the author was capable of give the audience guidance on the topic.

And that only for the Saturday, later, people moved to Valencia center to take some beers, and discuss random topics like the "for...else" construct, but that's other story.

Sunday, final day of the marathon, 24 more Talks and the final closing one. On this day from my assistance I'll remark:

- "asyncIO: póngase a la cola por favor" by Miguel Araujo y Jose Ignacio Galarza.

  Again the CTO and a developer of ticketea,on a great talk, explained us the behind scenes machinery of a bran new service to come on his enterprise implemented using asyncIO.

- "Funcional para trollear" by Alejandro Brito Monedero.

  What to say?, functional explained funny.

- "Hacking the Taiga" by David Barragán Merino.

  Lovely talk about the best open source agile tool, Taiga project. Some examples of the existing options to extend or integrate it.

Point, that on some of the talks, the speakers concluded, among other things, that python is a slow language, or at least the cpython implementation, which can be true, but, as if it were done on purpose, we reached the closing Talk...

The final closing Talk, "Dijkstra es mi pastor, nada me falta", by Víctor Terrón, personally, I enjoyed it a lot, a really advisable talk, (the videos will be available soon), just say, it touched the big question on why use a language like python, clearing any previous bad feeling about speed. For real, if you have a bit of time, and understand some spanish, watch it.

Once the talk finished, the organization got the word, by the lovely words of the mighty [Mai Giménez](https://github.com/maigimenez), talked about the big effort behind a event like this, of course she was right, it has been a big event, with amazing talks, and a lot of care and work on it.
